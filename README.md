A 'Music Company Database' is a collection of songs and relevant details - album, artist, composer, lyricist and producer, maintained and organised by a Music Company. It can be used in different platforms and one can easily implement it in their program through SQL embedding. The queries that have been executed, are provided in the repository. The repository also contains the EERM (Extended Entity Relationship Model) and the RM (Relational Model) for reference. Any kind of redundancy is also taken care of.

The main objective of this Database is to organise, retrieve and manage the songs' data in a systematic way with ease and consistency.
